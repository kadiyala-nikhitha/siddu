Artificial Intelligence in Medicine
there are top 4 applications of AI in medicine
1.Diagnose diseases
How machines learn to diagnose
More advanced AI diagnostics are coming soon
AI wont replace doctors anytime soon

2.Develop drugs faster
There are 4 main stages in drug development
step 1:Identifying targets for intervention
step 2:Discovering drug candidates
step 3:Speeding up clinical trails
step 4:Finding Biomakers for diagnosing the disease

3.Personalize treatment
4.Improve gene editing
